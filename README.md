**Title of the Project**: Online Parking System

**PROJECT AIMS AND OBJECTIVES**:
The aims and objectives are as follows:
•To allows employees to view and reserve parking slots for specific dates and times via a mobile app or web application.
•The system helps an individual to pre-book the parking spot from the distant area, reducing traffic congestion and allowing a user to know the availability of parking space in advance.
•The basic objective of a smart parking solution is to identify a vehicle's presence or absence in a particular parking space with a high degree of accuracy, and to pass on this data into a system for visualization and analysis – to be available for parking asset managers and/or enforcement officers.

Step 7: Arrival and Check-in: Users arrive at the parking location and check-in using their booking details.
Step 8: Parking Duration: The system monitors the parking duration based on the user's check- in and check-out times.
Step 9: Check-out and Payment Settlement: Users check out of the parking space and any additional charges are settled.
Step 10: User Feedback: Users have the option to provide feedback on their parking experience.
Step 11: Cancellation and Refunds: Users can cancel their parking booking and request a refund if needed, based on the system's cancellation policy.
Step 12: Booking Modifications: Users have the option to modify their booking details, such as changing the date or time of their parking reservation.
Step 13: Notifications and Reminders: The system sends notifications and reminders to users regarding their upcoming parking reservations.
Step 14: Feedback Analysis and Improvements: The system analyses user feedback to identify areas for improvement and make necessary enhancements to the parking system.
Step 15: Security and Safety Measures: The system ensures the safety and security of parked vehicles through measures like surveillance cameras, secure access points, and emergency protocols.
Step 16: Integration with Navigation Apps: The parking system may integrate with navigation apps to provide users with directions to their selected parking space.
